                        <p>The serrated mountains loomed in the distance. We made our way towards them as we had to make base camp by nightfall. They were flour-white and brooded over the land. Just as we approached, a chute of snow detached itself and went trundling down one of the mountains. It slid over the knotted edge and then went crashing into the chasm below. The silence that followed was spine chilling. It froze our marrow to think that we would be climbing in those conditions tomorrow.</p>

She comes in the way that natural forces do, needing not invitation yet feeling her welcome. The light is her gift, bold and free, for anyone who cares to open their eyes in the dawn and watch the world awake. This is our sun, a fire ignited to bring warmth to creation and inspire us to seek our own beauty within.</p>

As it is, I love dive within those salty formless arms and feel the freedom it gives, transparent and blue, soft and strong.</p>

                    <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline">A Complete Guide to The Swedish Ice Hotel</h1></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><input class="jpibfi" type="hidden"><img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel03.jpg" alt="Blue lobby area at the Swedish Ice Hotel in Northern Sweden" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/offbeat-of-the-month-the-swedish-ice-hotel/" data-jpibfi-post-title="A Complete Guide to The Swedish Ice Hotel" data-jpibfi-src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel03.jpg" ><br /> <strong>Updated:</strong> 1/5/19 | January 5th, 2019</p><p>In the heart of Swedish Lapland, the most northerly province of the country, is the Ice Hotel. Located some 1,200km north of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/stockholm-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockholm</a> in Jukkasjärvi, it has over 80 rooms and is built annually using ice from the nearby Torne River. The 30,000-square-foot hotel is located 200km north of the Arctic Circle and features an Absolut Vodka ice bar, an ice cinema, an ice chapel, ice family rooms, and ice suites. The whole structure uses 4,000 tons of ice.</p><p>In short, everything is about ice.</p><p>The hotel began in 1990 when French artist Jannot Derid held an exhibition in a cylinder-shaped igloo in the area. One night, there were no rooms available in the town, so some visitors slept in sleeping bags on top of reindeer skin, beginning the world’s first “ice hotel.”</p><p>In 2016, they expanded the hotel and there it&#8217;s now a permanent structure that is open to visitors all year around. That means that you&#8217;ll likely spend some of your nights &#8220;cold&#8221; (in an ice room) and others &#8220;warm&#8221; (in a regular room). You can decide which nights you want to spend warm or cold when you book.</p><h3>Swedish Icehotel: Room Prices</h3><p><img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel04.jpg" alt="Big bed in the Swedish Ice Hotel with animal fur blankets and ice sculptures" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/offbeat-of-the-month-the-swedish-ice-hotel/" data-jpibfi-post-title="A Complete Guide to The Swedish Ice Hotel" data-jpibfi-src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel04.jpg" ><br /> The winter is far and away the most popular time to visit as you&#8217;ll not only get to enjoy the icy accommodation in its natural habitat but you&#8217;ll also get to see the northern lights during your visit (which is well worth heading north to see!).</p><p>In the winter, expect to pay around 1,600 SEK per night for a standard warm room and 4,000 SEK per night for a standard cold room. Suites will cost between 5,500-8,100 SEK per night depending on how fancy you want to get. Deluxe suites even have direct access to the sauna, although the &#8220;regular&#8221; suites also access to the sauna.</p><h3>What to See and Do at the Ice Hotel</h3><p>There are tons of activities that you can take part in at the hotel and in the area. Here are a few of the best things to do when you visit the Icehotel in <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/lola-akerstrom-sweden-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweden</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Guided tour</strong> &#8211; Take a guided tour of the ice hotel and learn about it&#8217;s past, see the various rooms, and see how the hotel is actually built.</li><li><strong>Ice sculpting</strong> &#8211; Try your hand at ice sculpting yourself with this fun class.
